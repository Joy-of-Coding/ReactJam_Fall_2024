Greetings Adventurer 

Please allow me to guide through our little game for a better understanding of exactly what you have gotten yourself into. No take backs at this point, you can only move forward. 

Happy Adventuring, and let's get to it! 

1. Introduction screen 

    a. Please let us know if you liked our game when you finish by selecting the credits, viewing our   happy slaves who wrote this little adventure, and leave us a rating. Thanks for your feedback, it keeps our slaves happy and productive, without having to resort to Lash so much! 

2. The storyline progresses throughout the dungeon crawl, but please feel free to skip this all this drivel if some nasty monster cuts your head off and you have to start over. We do soo love for you to be able to exact your revenge on our various Hobgoblins. 

3. The main premise of the game (besides the Kill-or-be-Killed fun) is getting those annoying everyday Task List(s) out of the way so that you can enjoy a few hours of pleasant Dungeon Crawling at your leisure. 

    a. Before you can start the Adventure of a lifetime, you must complete 3 Real-Life tasks (we wouldnâ€™t want you get yelled at or quit you Dungeon Crawl); 

    b. Enter the 3 Tasks, complete all 3, and mark them off the list provided for you, easy peasy! 

    c. Life stuff completed and off to the Dungeon. 

4. Movement: Arrow keys - keyboard or mouse

5. Weapons and Armor are in Inventory 

6. Health Potions add +25 to life and can only be used when you are damaged before battle. Please, Adventurer, get strong before you tackle our nasty little surprises. 

7. Experience and leveling is automatic when you pass through the doorway to the next level. 

8. Last, and certainly Most Important, ENJOY! Let the stress of a hard day of Life slip away and bash our little monsters to your hearts content! Bye-bye, for now!  

Happy Adventuring, and let's get to it!
