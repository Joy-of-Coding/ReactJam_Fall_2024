George slows and peers cautiously into the dim light for a smoldering torch. The glint of a dinner-plate sized eyeball reflects back at him. ‘Wow, that is one big darn Snake! I better git to chopping.’  George shifts his grip on the rusty sword, mashes the dented helmet onto his head, and slowly advances on the writher mass of the giant, poisonous snake.... ",

George discards the rusty sword for an Obsidian Short War Spear nearly buried in the accumulated filth of past ages. He plods slowly on following the clearly etched prints left by the missing Bessie. He notices yet another vague shape in the undisturbed dust and as he brushes the thin layer of dirt away, a dull shine comes into the chest plate. He fastens it on around his pudgy middle and quickly raises his head as he hears somewhat familiar voice cackle, 'Well, George, you should have stayed Home!' The village hag, Kassie, now turned to the dark arts of necromancy, draws in a ragged, wet breath and smiles sinisterly, 'Now you shall have to join that wretched beast you were searching for!' Evil, menacing laughter assaults George's floppy ears as he raises the War Spear shakily for battle.... ",

But, I shall have my revenge – even now, my pet rushes forth to bring your ultimate demise!’ The laughter slowly died into low moaning sob and finally, died into a loud quiet that descended onto George with a heavy silence. He slowly looked around and shivered with the wet perspiration of fear drying slowly on his brow. He quickly scooped up the Heavy Spiked Mace and Emblazoned Shield discarded by the decrepit doorway. ‘Gods, what next? I hope Bessie is alright. What the heck took her down here anyway?’ George muttered softly under his breath and slowly raised his to behold Kassie’s Pet, a moldering 8 foot tall Giant Skeleton menacingly swinging a colossal battle-hammer with a giant’s thigh bone for a handle....

We never believed you would be able to guide dear George this far – we sincerely thought one of our nasty little monstrosities would have gobbled you up by now! You are resilient, and brave, but we digress, and now back to our little adventure.... George rubbed a sore shoulder where the Bone Hammer had shaken him to his ever-loving soul with a bone-chilling blow. He had kinda enjoyed smashing the animated bone pile into splinters and, he was surprised to admit that he was actually looking forward to the next encounter as he trudged into the next chamber. A headless stood across the room and beckoned him into the dimly lit regions of the vast dungeon. A massive Two-Handed Mithril Battle Axe dangled loosely in two stonehands encased in jet-black Spiked Hand Guards. George grunted with effort as the surprisingly light axe fell into arms. He leaned the axe against the statue as he drew the Spiked Hand Guards over his hands and once again hefted the axe to do battle against the forces of evil.... Holy Gods above, was that an Ettin rumbling down the corridor toward him?? ",

The murmur of voices was getting loudly with each step, and he thought that he might finally getting to the bottom of this demonic mystery. Wait, what the blazes is in that alcove? He muttered ruefully to himself. Yet another grand surprise in an already full day. Gods, if Martha, his dear departed wife could only see him now! She would probably not even recognize the usually stodgy farmer turned, well, a darn good adventur’r. Now, to see what had caught his eye before he started wool-gather with memories of his long dead love. A dead-of-night black staff which glowed softly as he gripped it strongly and searching further, a Radiant Great Helm revealed itself in the back of the alcove. Tossing the battered and dented helmet aside, he settled the dimly lit helm on this head and tightened the strap firmly under his chin. He raised his head proudly and marched purposefully toward the sound of chanting....   Oh, this is so exciting, Dear Adventurer, we can hardly wait to observe what poor George will encounter next, chilling....   As George rounded the bend into the brightly lit chamber, a strange sense sadness slumped his shoulder and bowed his scruffy head as he exclaimed, out loud, ‘Damn, those weird visions from Dungeon Level One were actually true – That witch turned my poor Bessie into a demon Cow!! With a mighty howl of anguish and frustration, George snapped the Two-Handed Mithril Battle Axe from where it was secured across his massive back and threw it with all his might at his former best friend, Bessie. Splat, the axe head split the poor demonic bovine into two equal halves. A single tear rolled majestically down Goerge's craggy face as his face scrunched into of pure, malevolent rage.  He advanced on the object of his fury, the pinnacle of evil incarnate, The Shadow Drow Queen. ‘You destroyed my friend, and I am here to send you back to whatever demonic pit you crawled out of! .... There is more, Dear Adventurer, but I am afraid that good taste requires that I censure the rest of poor George’s rage.... With a heart-rending scream of anguish, George swung the inky black staff at the tattooed face smiling malevolently at him and a strangely dark light emblazoned forth as it descended as the fanged mouth of the black-hearted Drow chanted on and on, washing slowly over him....
